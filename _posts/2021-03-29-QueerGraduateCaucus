## The Queer Graduate Caucus' Open Letter to the Administration

  <openletter>
    <addressed>To whom it may concern</addressed> – 
    <intro>
      <sit>In light of the larger discussions on the topic of <iss>diversity</iss> and <iss>inclusion</iss> which have been happening on <place>campus</place> <time>of late</time></sit>, the <org>Queer Graduate Caucus</org> would like to highlight some concerns relating to <comm>LGBTQIA+ <body>graduate students</body></comm>. <time>Last year</time> several of our <position>officers</position> were included in <dialogue>panel discussions and conversations</dialogue> with <position>administrators</position> and some of these issues were raised, but as we have not yet received a <dialogue> response</dialogue> from the <body>administration</body> about their disposition we consider it worthwhile to reiterate them. 
    </intro> 
    <demand1>
      <time>After third year</time>, <body><persons>graduate students</persons></body> are <sit>no longer guaranteed <aid>on-campus housing</aid></sit>. The most common destinations for these individuals are <place>Philadelphia</place> and <place> New York City</place>. In the state of <place>Pennsylvania</place>, there are <iss>no <authority>laws</authority> protecting against discrimination on the basis of <identity>sexual orientation</identity> or <identity>gender identity</identity></iss>. This includes <iss>housing discrimination</iss>. Even though the <place>city of New York</place> has <authority>ordinances</authority> aiming to prevent this, the search for apartments is fraught with additional risks for <comm>LGBTQIA+ people</comm>; <iss>there is a constant need to screen potential <persons>roommates</persons> and <persons>landlords</persons> for <marg>homophobic</marg> or <marg>transphobic</marg> attitudes in order to avoid not only discrimination but also harassment</iss>. Additionally, <iss><comm><body>graduate students</body> of color</comm> must negotiate around <marg>racism</marg> during housing searches</iss>. This not only places a considerable burden on <body>graduate students<body> in the form of the <resource>time</resource> involved in such housing searches, but also restricts their ability to find <resource>affordable</resource> housing off campus. Therefore, we consider it paramount that the <institution>Graduate School</institution> and the <body><institution>University's</institution> housing administration</body> renew their commitment to providing <resource>affordable</resource> <aid>on-campus housing</aid> sufficient to meet <body>graduate student</body> demand. <aid>Information</aid> about housing and housing options should also be more effectively distributed to new <body>graduate students</body>. 
    </demand1>
    <demand2>
      <aid><institution>Princeton's</institution> Student Health Plan</aid> is admirable in that it allows for coverage of several medical options for <comm><persons>transgender students</persons></comm>. However, the <iss><authority>official policy</authority> arbitrarily excludes certain procedures on the grounds of their being "cosmetic" without providing any rationale for the distinction</iss>. This <authority>policy</authority> is rooted in <marg>cissexism</marg> and should be revised with the participation of <comm><persons>transgender students</persons></comm> and <authority>professionals expert in transgender medicine</authority>. 
    </demand2>
    <demand3>
      This organization, the <org>Queer Graduate Caucus</org>, currently has <iss>no <resource>annual budget</resource></iss>. In order to hold even small events, we must go through the drawn-out process of requesting <aid>co-sponsorship</aid> and <aid>funds</aid> from several other organizations, <body>programs</body>, and <body>departments</body>. This makes <iss>the task of event organization very unwieldy and unreliable</iss>. With the generosity and support of many <position>administrators</position> and <position>fellow <body>student</body> leaders</position>, we have been able to hold significant, well-attended events such as last Fall's <event>"Transitioning History with Susan Stryker,"</event> but only with exceptional <resource>effort</resource> and <resource>time</resource> investment by our <position>officers</position>. In <authority><position>President</position> Eisgruber's</authority> response to the <org>Task Force for Diversity and Inclusion</org>, he wrote that the <comm><institution>Princeton University</institution> community</comm> could anticipate an <quote>"increase in <aid>funding</aid> for <body>student</body> initiatives, including those housed in the <body>Fields Center</body>, <body>Women's Center</body>, and <body>LGBT Center</body>, as well as for <comm>identity-based student</comm> organizations."</quote> We humbly request that this include our organization. 
    </demand3>
    <demand4>
      Finally, we would like to emphasize the importance of including <body>graduate students</body> (as well as <body>undergraduate students</body>) in the decision-making process surrounding issues which directly affect our lives. Regular <aid>communication</aid> between <position>administrators</position> and <position><body>graduate student </body>leaders</position> would facilitate this, and would enhance the <comm>campus community<comm>. 
    </demand4>
    <conclusion> We look forward to further discussion with you on these matters. </conclusion>
